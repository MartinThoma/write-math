Thank you very much for contributing to this service.

I've collected 160,901 training instances the last view days. This enourmous
amount of training data (almost everything from detexify) makes a server change
necessary.

I guess the service will be back in two days (Saturday, 19.07.2014).

Thanks for contributing!
