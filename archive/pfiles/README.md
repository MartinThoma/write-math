All pfiles should be placed in this folder. The naming scheme is as follows:

`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-[type].pfile` where `[type]` is one of the following:

* testdata
* validdata
* traindata

Usually, all three should be there. The timestap `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM` should be
the time of the creating of those pfiles, where pfiles that belong together
must have the same timestamp.
