  Abstract                 = {Automatic recognition of on-line mathematical expressions is di$cult especially when there exist errors. In this paper, we incorporate an error detection and correction mechanism into a parser developed previously by us based on de&quot;nite clause grammar (DCG). The resulting system can handle lexical, syntactic and some semantic errors. The recognition speed for 600 commonly seen expressions is quite acceptable, ranging from 0.73 to 6 s per expression on a modest workstation. In addition, we propose a performance evaluation scheme which can be used to demonstrate the e!ectiveness of both the symbol recognition and structural analysis stages by a single measure. � 2001 Pattern},

The method is based on combining the decisions of two multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network classifiers operating on two different feature types. The first feature set is defined on the pseudo Zernike moments of the image whereas the second feature type is derived from the shadow code of the image using a newly defined projection mask. A MLP network is employed to perform the combination task. The performance is tested on a data base of 15000 samples and the advantage of the combination approach is demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach for parsing two- dimensional input using relational grammars and fuzzy sets. A fast, incremental parsing algorithm is devel- oped, motivated by the two-dimensional structure of written mathematics. The approach reports all identifi- able parses of the input. The parses are represented as a fuzzy set, in which the membership grade of a parse measures the similarity between it and the handwrit- ten input. To identify and report parses efficiently, we adapt and apply existing techniques such as rectangular partitions and shared parse forests, and introduce new ideas such as relational classes and interchangeability. We also present a correction mechanism which allows users to navigate parse results and choose the correct interpretation in case of recognition errors or ambigu- ity. Such corrections are incorporated into subsequent incremental recognition results. Finally, we include two empirical evaluations of our recognizer. One uses a novel user-oriented correction count metric, while the other replicates the CROHME 2011 math recognition con- test. Both evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

Our preprocessing transforms the original coordinate sequence into a (still temporal) sequence of feature vectors, which combine strictly local features, like curvature or writing direction, with a bitmap-like representation of the coordinate 's proximity. The MS-TDNN architecture is well suited for handling temporal sequences as provided by this input representation. Our system is tested both on writer dependent and writer independent tasks with vocabulary sizes ranging from 400 up to 20,000 words.

Using dictionaries of this size requires fast search techniques to achieve reasonable recognition times. In this paper we present a search approach yielding recognition times, which are virtually independent of the dictionary size. This approach combines a tree representation of the dictionary with efficent pruning techniques to reduce the search space without loosing much recognition performance compared to a flat exhaustive search through all words in the dictionary. The tree search with pruning is about 15 times faster than a flat search and allows us to run the NPen++ on-line handwriting recognition system in real-time with dictionary sizes up to 100,000 words.},

  Abstract                 = {Current equation editing systems rely on either textbased equation description languages or on interactive construction by means of structure templates and menus. These systems are often tedious to use, even for experts, because the user is forced to "parse" the expressions mentally before they are entered. This step is not normally part of the process of writing equations on paper or on a whiteboard. We describe a prototype equation editor that is based on handwriting recognition and automatic equation parsing. It is coupled with a user interface that incorporates a set of simple procedures for correcting errors made by the automatic interpretation. Although some correction by the user is typically necessary before the formula is recognized, we have found that the system is simpler and more natural to use than systems based on specialized languages or template-based interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a technique for enhancing a user's ability to manipulate hand-printed symbolic information by automatically improving legibility and simultaneously providing immediate feedback on the system's current structural interpretation of the information. Our initial application is a handwriting-based equation editor. Once the user has written a formula, the individual hand-drawn symbols can be gradually translated and scaled to closely approximate their relative positions and sizes in a corresponding typeset version. These transformations preserve the characteristics, or style, of the original userdrawn symbols. In applying this style-preserving morph, the system improves the legibility of the user-drawn symbols by correcting alignment and scaling, and also reveals the baseline structure of the symbols that has been inferred by system. We performed a preliminary user study that indicates that this new method of feedback is a useful addition to a conventional interpretive interface. We believe this is because the style preserving morph makes it easier to understand the correspondence between the original input and interpreted output than methods that radically change the appearance of the original input. Key words: formula entry, math recognition, mental map, morphing, pen-based computing, user feedback. 1},
