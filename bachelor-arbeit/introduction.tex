\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:Introduction}

Handwriting recognition is the problem of finding a proper textual representation
given a handwritten symbol or sequence of symbols.

In off-line handwriting recognition, all algorithms have to work on pixel image
information of the handwriting. On-line handwriting recognition on the other
hand can use the information how symbols were written. This thesis is about
on-line handwriting recognition.


\section{Mathematical notation}

I will use the notation $v^{(i)}$ when I want to write about the $i$-th element
of a vector $v$. Vectors will always be denoted by lowercase latin letters.

Matrices will be denoted by uppercase latin letters.
