\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:Introduction}

Handwriting recognition is the problem of finding a proper textual representation
given a handwritten symbol or sequence of symbols.

In off-line handwriting recognition, all algorithms have to work on pixel image
information of the handwriting. On-line handwriting recognition on the other
hand can use the information how symbols were written.
