\chapter{Baseline system} %TODO
\label{ch:Content1}


A system for symbol recognition was already written and is described in \cite{Kirsch}.
It uses an algorithm called greedy matching which is similar to \Gls{DTW}.

The Greedy Matching algorithm takes two series of points $(A, B)$ and matches
the first points $(a,b)$ of $A$ to $B$. The distance that point had to be moved is
measured. Afterwards, it tries to match the next point $a'$ of $A$ to $b$ as
well as the next point $b'$ of $B$ and $b'$ to $a$. It takes the matching in
which the points had to be moved the shortest distance and continues like that.

Pseudocode is on \cpageref{alg:greedy-matching}.

\chapter{Artificial Neural Nets}\label{ch:ANNs}

\Glspl{ANN} are models for classification that were inspired by the brain.
They consist of artificial neurons and have a lot of different subtypes like
Feed Forward Neural Nets.
